# Tic-Tac-Toe

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in [Java / Python / your language]. This project allows two players to compete against each other on the same machine or, optionally, against the computer. It features a simple and user-friendly interface with the option to track scores.

## Features
- **Two-player mode:** Play locally with a friend.
- **Single-player mode:** Play against the computer (AI-based difficulty optional).
- **Score tracking:** Keep track of wins for each player.
- **Interactive UI:** Easy-to-use interface for smooth gameplay.
- **Cross-platform:** Runs on any system that supports [Java / your language].

## How to Play
- Players take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid.
- The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If all cells are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
